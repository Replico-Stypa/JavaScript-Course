# How to learn JavaScript [Step-by-Step Guide]

## Introduction

JavaScript is a free scripting language that works on client-side as well as server-side. It is text-based and works along-side HTML and CSS to enhance code functionality and add interactive elements. In short, JS can bring life to otherwise boring and static web pages. JS is interpreted, which means the code need not be compiled. For huge projects that use a lot of interactive content, separate JavaScript files with the extension .js are created. However, JS can also be embedded in HTML code using `<script>` tag. Some common use-cases of JS are interactive maps, live news updates, form validations, creating landing pages, etc.

#### A simple JS program is as follows:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>
<h2>JavaScript Example</h2>
<p id="demo">I will change once you Click! the button...</p>
<button type="button" onclick='document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = "Hello Beautiful!"'>Click!</button>
</body>
</html>
```

In this code, the text is changed on click of the button ‘Click!’ due to the onClick JavaScript event

## Advantages of JavaScript

JavaScript completely changed the way the world looked at browsers. It gave the ability to build complex websites and make the whole business process digital! Some advantages of JavaScript are:

- High performance: JS is lightweight & fast as it can be immediately run on the browser (client machine)

- Simple and popular: We have been using it for ages, and it hasn’t lost the hold!

- Interoperable: can be used with a variety of other languages and applications

- Reduces server load as it works on the client-side

- Makes pages lively, dynamic, and rich

- It comes with many free tools to enhance functionality

- The functionality of JS can be extended to the backend using Node.js

## Job Prospects

JavaScript stands firm, and why not; web applications are the present and the future of this changing digital world. New websites are added every single day with loads of interactive elements, which means there will always be work for JavaScript developers. That is why it is one of the Top 5 programming languages of 2020. There are about 24000 job openings for JS developers, and on average, they are paid about $118k per year.

## Prerequisites

To learn JavaScript, you must know the basics of HTML and CSS, both of which are extremely easy to learn. For a working knowledge of JavaScript and most web-based projects, this knowledge will be sufficient. For more advanced projects and skills, it is recommended to know basic OOP concepts and an OOP based programming language (like Java).

You can install an IDE or use code editors, or even use notepad or Textpad to write JS code. IDEs and editors provide intuitive programming experience and faster results than programming with editors like notepad, where you have to type everything from scratch.

# IDE

Although you can type and run a JS program with a notepad, an IDE makes it easy to debug the code and provide support to ALM (Application Lifecycle Management) systems. Here are the top 3 IDEs/source-code editors:

- WebStorm: WebStorm provides smart assistance and code completion, refactoring for CSS, TypeScript, JS. You can test your functionality and troubleshoot with the built-in debugger that targets both Node.js and client-side code. Use the 30-day trial version to get the feel of the product before you go for buying it.

- Visual Studio Code: There is literally no language that VS Code doesn’t support. It is a free, developer-friendly cross-platform IDE that offers features like built-in Git integration, smart code completion, code debugging from the editor itself, and much more. It is highly extensible.

- Atom: Atom is a highly popular IDE from GitHub. It provides smart context-based code completion, easy code navigation, a full set of diagnostic tools to understand and debug code, and many more features. It is free and open-source, and you can add some fun to your coding using the pre-installed themes and styles.

## ONLINE JAVASCRIPT IDE:

AWS Cloud9: Apart from JS, AWS Cloud9 also supports development for C, C++, Perl, Python, Node.js, etc. It is entirely written in JS, and the backend is in Node.js. It is an online open-source IDE, and one needs an AWS account to get access. Some features are syntax highlighting, support for npm and basic UNIX commands, simultaneous editing, real-time language analysis, and customizable key bindings.

## How To Learn JavaScript

Many free and paid courses and tutorials are available to learn JavaScript. For in-depth knowledge, you can also purchase a few good books like [ A Smarter Way to Learn JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1497408180?tag=hackr0df-21) and [Effective JavaScript: 68 Specific Ways to Harness the Power of JavaScript](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0321812182?tag=hackr0df-21). However, to start working on projects, you need only a little theory and more hands-on, so we recommend you to take up tutorials and short courses that will get you onboard quickly.
